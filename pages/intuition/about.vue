          GreenCheddar is a voluntary carbon or emissions trading system aiming
          to increase accessibility at the individual or household level. It
          helps you contribute to the local and global fight against climate
          change. GreenCheddar is also a tool for the circular economy and a fun

        <h1 class="font-semibold text-gray-600 text-xl mb-2">Our Vision</h1>
        <p class="text-sm">
          To increase sustainability and reduce carbon emissions for each
          individual. With our tailored features, GreenCheddar is able to
          convert your carbon footprint into an online currency that allows you
          to buy, sell and trade products within your local environment. By
          simply uploading information about your living cost, such as your
          electricity and gas bills, where you buy your food etc, GreenCheddar
          will automatically calculate your carbon footprint and provide more
          information about how to reduce your carbon footprint in your day to
          day life. The lower your carbon footprint, the higher your online
          currency will be on the app, encouraging us all to reduce our carbon
          footprint and become more sustainable.
