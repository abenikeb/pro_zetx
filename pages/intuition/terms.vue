        <p class="text-sm">
          A Carbon Footprint is a quantity of greenhouse gasses (GHG) that are
          emitted by an individual, organization, process or event. Carbon
          footprints are often used as a tool to aid the reduction of GHG
          emissions.

          A way for people, companies, or organizations of any kind to “offset”
          their carbon footprint, this is done by reducing or removing carbon
          dioxide emissions to compensate for the production of carbon dioxide
          in different processes.
